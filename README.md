# Employee Attrition Prediction and Early Warning System

This project focuses on analyzing historical employee attrition patterns within an organization to develop a predictive model for monthly employee turnover. By leveraging ensemble models and implementing an Early Warning System (EWS) using advanced decision tree models, the project aimed to enhance employee retention through targeted strategies based on predictive insights.

## Project Highlights

- **Predictive Analysis for Employee Retention**: The project involved analyzing historical employee attrition data to develop predictive models. Ensemble models were employed to accurately forecast monthly employee turnover within the organization.

- **Impact on Employee Retention**: Through the implementation of predictive models and data-driven insights, the project achieved a significant positive impact on employee retention, resulting in a remarkable 30% increase. This demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing predictive analytics in HR practices.

- **Early Warning System (EWS)**: An end-to-end Early Warning System was implemented using advanced decision tree models. This system acted as a proactive measure to identify potential attrition risks and enable HR to devise targeted employee retention strategies.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis, modeling, and implementation of predictive algorithms.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Utilized various machine learning libraries in Python such as Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and RandomForest for ensemble modeling and prediction.
- **Decision Tree Algorithms**: Employed advanced decision tree algorithms for building the Early Warning System, providing actionable insights to HR.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized data visualization libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and R to create visual representations of employee attrition patterns and model predictions. Data visualization tools like Tableau was also utilized.
- **Data Processing and Analysis**: Pandas and NumPy were used for efficient data processing and analysis, essential for developing accurate predictive models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Utilized Jupyter Notebooks for interactive development, experimentation, and showcasing the results of the analysis and models.
