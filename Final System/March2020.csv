They need to understand employees' feelings. Some people had a rough day at home, but Managers care less to know. Instead, they want to write them off, sometimes without verbal coaching. Internal promotion from a Tier III upward is difficult (I might say in some buildings from experience). Some Tier III associates have been in that position for more than 3 years, have degrees coupled with experience, but are usually denied to move up. Thus, they rather resign and then reply externally to be hired upward.",1

Even at the time of rewards and recognition the upper level management congratulates and appraise each other ; ironically which is meant for employees. This time they cut a few rewards and made their own rewards. The upper management don' even know names of employees who are working for company for more than 2-3 years. They only remember names of a few buttering agents. Management suddenly appears on floors when a client or someone from US is visiting otherwise they remain out of picture the whole time.,1

You are treated like a number rather than a human. All that matters is if you get your quota done. If you question anything, you get a target on your back.

Morale is terrible at the Salt Lake location, everyone wants to leave, except for upper management who go around congratulating each other on how well they (upper management) are doing, while treating people below them like crap. All of the work is being sent to India, and they are happy to let knowledgeable, talented people walk out in order to get rid of anyone who thinks for themselves and might question something. They put no value on experience. If you try to work with HR, they just ignore you hoping the problem will go away. They really just prefer automatons to do what they are told as fast as they can and don't think for themselves. Seriously, anywhere is better than here.",1

The promotion system is designed to be fair by having anonymous committees review written packets and you can self-nominate, but as a result the burden of proving you are promotable is extremely high. You (or your manager) really have to be focused on promotion, find and work on projects with the right demonstrable complexity and impact, and have extensive written documentation and peer statements to validate.

We were told at orientation that you would be paid an extra 50 cents an hour if you took a night shift, and an extra 50 an hour if you worked a weekend shift. This is not true. When you ask a supervisor/manager/HR about it, they have no idea what you are talking about. next, It's a boring job. The place is extremely disorganized, but the employees are micro-managed to death. It's a huge (1 million sq. ft.), 3 floor, facility and the only set of restrooms are on the bottom floor. So depending on where you are working that day, sometimes you can't get to the restrooms before you have to turn around and start walking back to avoid being late back from break. If you catch yourself making a mistake, there is no way to correct it. You just have to let it go through and realize you might be written up/fired for it. This is especially bad, because there is no learning curve for the job, and new employees are held to higher accuracy quotas than permanent employees. Permanent employees have to work faster though, which leads to the problem of you trying to stock shelves where someone has dumped a cart full of random objects, packed them in with their foot, then scanned them and run off Obviously, it's hot and dusty (it's a warehouse).",1
